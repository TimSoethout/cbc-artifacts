## TLA+ models

Containing:

- RV-SER
- LoCA with CBC/SCBC
- 2PL/2PC

Please see `Readme.adoc` in the `tla` directory for more specifics.

## SMT Static CBC

In the `SCBC` folder you find multiple Rascal modules. The `rebel-cbc` module contains the SCBC checks using SMT solver Z3.

Tested/Run with:

- Rascal Version: 0.18.2 (https://update.rascal-mpl.org/stable)
- Z3 version 4.8.8 - 64 bit

### Overview

The Rascal source code can be run using Eclipse with the Rascal plugin.

This folder contains an Eclipse workspace containing all the modules required to run the Analysis.

    rebel-core: Rebel DSL core
    rebel-eclipse: Rebel DSL tooling to use in Eclipse
    rebel-cbc: The analysis tool
    smtlib2: Grammar and tools to output SMTLIB constraints

### Run the CBC analysis

In order to run this, you require Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) and Z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki). Z3 can be installed on Mac OSX via homebrew (brew cask install z3).

To reproduce the results from the paper, do the following steps:

    Open all projects in the `SCBC` folder in Eclipse.

    Open the Rascal REPL in Eclipse by right clicking on source file: |project://rebel-cbc/src/cbc/tests/CbcTests.rsc| and selecting Run as > Rascal Application.

    After loading type/copy: `analyse(verySimple, scoRetvalAndPostStateAssert, scoRetvalAndPostStateAssert);`. The tool will return the SCBC table as done in the paper.
